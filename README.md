# credit-risk-classification

1. Purpose

The goal was using the dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, create a model that will help identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

2. Bulleted List

- Balance Score: 95% = most important %, this % gives us a way to detail the accuracy of the model
- Precision Score: 92% = indicates correct % of predicted postives 
- Recall Score: 95% = indicates correct % of when measuring true postiive values out of positive predictions made

3. Recommendation

Because of the 95% Balanced Score, I would still recommend using this model to help identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
